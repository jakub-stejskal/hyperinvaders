## Project description

HyperInvaders is a shoot 'em up game inspired by [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) .

It was created in 2013 by Jakub Stejskal, as a course project of A0M33KAJ (Client applications development in JavaScript). As such, it served mainly as an opportunity to practice development with modern web technologies and it lacks some features of the original game.

The game should run on any desktop and mobile system provided that it has browser with HTML5 support comparable to main browsers as of 2013.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakub-stejskal/hyperinvaders).
